Description: Calibrates survey weights to known population targets using regularized
    raking. Constraints are specified with a formula interface (for example,
    rr_exact(), rr_l2(), rr_range(), rr_mean(), rr_var(), and rr_quantile()).
    Supports common target formats including autumn-style proportions tables,
    raw or weighted population microdata, named-list targets (as in
    'anesrake'), and 'survey' package design
    objects. Optimization follows Barratt et al. (2021)
    <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/optimal_representative_sampling.pdf>
    and returns calibrated weights with balance and convergence diagnostics.
