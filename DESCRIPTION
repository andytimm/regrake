Description: A modern implementation of regularized survey raking that prioritizes 
    intuitive interfaces while maintaining flexibility and power. Built on the 
    mathematical framework from Barratt et al. (2021) 
    <https://www-leland.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/optimal_representative_sampling.pdf>, 
    the package provides straightforward formula interfaces for survey weight calibration 
    using various loss functions and regularization methods. Supports multiple target 
    specification formats and integrates smoothly with common survey analysis workflows.
