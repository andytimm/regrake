Description: Implements regularized survey raking for finding optimal survey weights,
    based on the mathematical framework from Barratt et al. (2021)
    <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/optimal_representative_sampling.pdf>.
    Provides a formula interface for specifying raking constraints with multiple loss
    types (exact, least squares, KL divergence, inequality) and regularization methods
    (entropy, sum of squares, KL). Supports six population target formats and integrates
    smoothly with common survey analysis workflows.
