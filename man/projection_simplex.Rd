\title{Project vector onto probability simplex}
\usage{
projection_simplex(v, z = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{Numeric vector to project}

\item{z}{Target sum (default 1)}
}
\value{
Projected vector that sums to z with non-negative elements
}
\description{
Projects a vector onto the probability simplex using a sort-based algorithm.
While algorithms with better theoretical complexity exist (e.g., Blondel
2014, Condat 2016, Dai/Chen 2022), with a decent bit of testing I found this
sort-based approach is hard to beat in practice.
