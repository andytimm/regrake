\title{Proximal operator for boolean regularizer}
\usage{
prox_boolean_reg(w, lam, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Input vector of weights}

\item{lam}{Regularization parameter (unused, kept for interface consistency)}

\item{k}{Number of samples to select}
}
\value{
Vector with k non-zero entries, each equal to 1/k
}
\description{
Selects top-k weights and assigns them equal weight 1/k.
All other weights are set to zero. This is used for representative
sample selection where exactly k samples should be selected.
}
\examples{
prox_boolean_reg(c(0.3, 0.1, 0.6), lam = 0.5, k = 2)
}
