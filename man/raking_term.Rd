\title{Create a raking formula term}
\usage{
raking_term(formula, type = c("exact", "l2", "kl"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A one-sided formula specifying variables (e.g., \code{~ race + age})}

\item{type}{The type of constraint ("exact", "l2", "kl")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific constraint types}
}
\value{
A raking_term object that can be combined with other terms
}
\description{
Creates a raking constraint term that can be combined with other terms using the \code{+} operator.
Each term represents a specific type of constraint (exact, L2, or KL) and includes a formula
specifying which variables to include in the constraint.
}
\details{
Raking terms are the building blocks of the raking formula interface. Each term specifies
a single constraint type (exact matching, L2 distance, or KL divergence) and the variables
to which that constraint applies.

The formula within a term can include:
\itemize{
\item Main effects: \code{~ x + y}
\item Interactions: \code{~ x:y}
\item Transformations: \code{~ I(x^2) + log(y)}
}

Terms can be combined using the \code{+} operator to create complex raking specifications
with multiple constraints.

\examples{
# Create a term directly
raking_term(~ race + age, type = "exact")

# Typically used via wrapper functions
rr_exact(~ race + age)
rr_l2(~ race:educ)
}
