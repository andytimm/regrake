\title{Project vector onto bounded probability simplex}
\usage{
projection_bounded_simplex(v, lower, upper, z = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{Numeric vector to project}

\item{lower}{Lower bound for each element (scalar or vector)}

\item{upper}{Upper bound for each element (scalar or vector)}

\item{z}{Target sum (default 1)}
}
\value{
Projected vector that sums to z with elements in \verb{[lower, upper]}
}
\description{
Projects a vector onto the probability simplex with per-element bounds.
Uses a sorting-based algorithm that finds the exact threshold by binary
search over breakpoints where elements transition between bounds.
