\title{Process survey design object}
\usage{
process_survey_design_data(design, formula_spec)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A survey.design object from the survey package}

\item{formula_spec}{A parsed raking formula specification from parse_raking_formula}
}
\description{
Extracts population information from a survey design object.
Uses the formula specification from regrake to determine which variables
to extract, and the design weights to compute target values.
}
\section{Processing Steps}{

\enumerate{
\item Validate design object and extract variables/weights
\item Use formula_spec to determine which variables are needed
\item For categorical variables: compute weighted proportions
\item For continuous variables: compute weighted mean
\item For interactions: compute joint distribution
\item Format in autumn format
