\title{Target Value Computation for Raking}
\usage{
process_pop_data(population_data, pop_type, pop_weights = NULL)
}
\description{
This file contains functions for computing target values used in raking.
The main workflow is:
\enumerate{
\item User provides population data in one of several supported formats
\item Data is converted to a standardized "autumn" format (which I think is most elegant)
\item Target values are computed for each term in the raking formula based on the formula specification
}

Currently implemented formats:
\itemize{
\item proportions: "autumn" style data frame with variable, level, target columns
}

Future formats (not yet implemented):
\itemize{
\item weighted: target data with weights
\item anesrake: List of named vectors (anesrake package format)
\item survey: Data frame with margin, category, value columns
\item survey_design: survey package design object
\item raw: Unit-level data to compute targets from
}

The autumn format is a standardized data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item variable: Name of the variable or interaction (e.g., "age" or "race:age")
\item level: Level within the variable (for categorical) or statistic name (for continuous, e.g., "mean")
\item target: Target value for that level (proportion for categorical, value for continuous)
}

Main entry point for converting population data into the autumn format.
Detects the input format and dispatches to the appropriate processor.

\itemize{
\item proportions: Has variable, level, target (or proportion) columns
\item weighted: Has specified weights column
\item anesrake: List of named numeric vectors
\item survey: Has margin, category, value columns
