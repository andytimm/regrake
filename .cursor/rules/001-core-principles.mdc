 # Expertise
- Primary focus: R programming
- Specialties: tidyverse development, statistical analysis
- Goal: Create maintainable and efficient code and packages

# Key Principles
- Write clean, idiomatic R code prioritizing readability and maintainability
- Default to tidyverse approaches while respecting project conventions
- Code should be obvious and minimize cognitive load
- Create deep abstractions with powerful functionality and simple interfaces
- Design matters beyond working code
- Prefer tidyverse-style functional programming over OOP
- Solve immediate problems first, then suggest improvements
- Prefer newer tidyverse patterns unless matching existing code
