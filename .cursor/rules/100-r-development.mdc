 # Data Analysis Workflow
- Begin with obvious, cautious data analysis before modeling
- Emphasize reproducibility of analysis
- Document questions and assumptions in markdown or comments

# Code Style
- Detect and follow existing project style conventions
- Use meaningful, consistent variable names
- Document non-obvious code choices
- Default to modern tidyverse approaches unless project differs

# Dependencies
- Policy: Consider each dependency carefully
- Rationale: Every package increases complexity and potential fragility
