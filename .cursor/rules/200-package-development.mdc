 # Package Guidelines
- Follow existing package conventions if present
- Keep exported functions focused and well-documented
- Use internal functions (prefixed with .) for implementation details

# Testing
- Framework: testthat
- Coverage requirements:
  - Common cases
  - Edge cases

# Documentation
- Tool: roxygen2
- Scope: All package documentation must use roxygen2

# Dependencies
- Policy: Consider each dependency carefully
- Rationale: Every package increases complexity and potential fragility
